Description: Constrained quantile regression is performed. One constraint is that all beta coefficients (including the constant) cannot be negative, they can be either 0 or strictly positive. Another constraint is that the beta coefficients lie within an interval. References: Koenker R. (2005) Quantile Regression, Cambridge University Press. <doi:10.1017/CBO9780511754098>.
